      <p>
        Welcome to PetPal! We are dedicated to connecting pets with loving families. Our mission is to provide a reliable and user-friendly platform where users can browse available pets, learn about them, and apply for adoption. At PetPal, we believe every pet deserves a home and that the adoption process should be as smooth as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our team is passionate about animal welfare and strives to create an environment where adoption becomes a positive experience for both pets and their future owners. We collaborate with shelters and foster homes to ensure every pet listed on our platform has received proper care.
